# Project2-Employee-database

In a recent project, I leveraged PostgreSQL as the primary database system, establishing a comprehensive structure within the "employee_db" database. This included six meticulously designed tables: "departments," "department_employee," "department_manager," "employee," "salary," and "title," each containing specific data pertinent to our analysis.

After seamlessly integrating PostgreSQL with Spyder, I orchestrated the extraction of critical data into Python scripts for in-depth analysis. Using Python, I executed meticulously curated queries to extract invaluable insights, answering pivotal questions that illuminated various facets of our dataset:

1. I meticulously checked for and rectified any data inconsistencies.

2. Identified departments with the highest average salary among active employees, substantiated with informative visual plots.

3. Determined which job titles commanded the highest average salaries, substantiated with compelling visualizations.

4. Visualized the distribution of salaries across different job titles, offering a comprehensive view of compensation structures.

5. Illustrated the distribution of salaries across departments, shedding light on departmental remuneration disparities.

6. Analyzed the count of active managers in each department, investigating potential managerial gaps.

7. Depicted the composition of job titles within departments through insightful graphical representations.

8. Highlighted the composition of departments based on job titles, offering a nuanced perspective.

9. Discerned the salaries of active departmental managers, pinpointing the highest-earning managerial roles.

10.Unveiled the job titles of active department managers, examining their diverse roles beyond managerial duties.

11.Tracked the historical salary trends of managers across departments on a yearly basis, facilitating longitudinal analysis.

12.Investigated the salary distribution among employees based on their tenure - 10 years, 4 years, and 1 year - for a comparative analysis.

13.Calculated the average number of years employees work in the company before departing, categorized by job titles.

14.Calculated the average tenure of employees in the company before leaving, categorized by departments.

15.Determined the median annual salary increment within departments, providing crucial insights into compensation growth trends.


This project underscores the power of database management and Python analysis in deciphering complex datasets, offering actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making.
